# Guess-guess
A flask project that guesses the age and gender of the provided name.
This was made possible with the genderize and ageify APIs. 
To use, run flask app on your machine. Ensure you have installed all packages and modules. Also, create a virtual environment.
The app runs on port 5000. Make sure you have no other app running on that port.
Use the path .../guess/<name you wish to check> and you are good to go.
